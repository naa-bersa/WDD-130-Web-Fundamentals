                    <P class="capecoast">Cape Coast Castle is the largest of the buildings which contains the legacy of the
                        trans-Atlantic slave trade and is a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Like most ancient fortifications in
                        Ghana, Cape Coast Castle played a significant role in the gold and slave trades.Guests are able to
                        view the cannons, tour the Dalzel Tower, and journey inside dark dungeons where slaves were held.
                        Thousands took their last steps through the Door of No Return, one of the most known parts of the
                        Cape Coast Castle, before being led onto ships during the Middle Passage.

                    which, having been built at the height of the trans-Saharan trade, is reputed to be Ghana's oldest
                    mosque and houses a copy of the Qur'an almost as old.[1]

                    The village is also known for its Mystic Stone, for its patterned vernacular architecture, and as
                    the entrance to the Mole National Park. Larabanga has a legend of the mystic stone.
